Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that returns the maximum sum. A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily pass through the root.

Solution

This problem follows the Binary Tree Path Sum pattern and shares the algorithmic logic with Tree Diameter. We can follow the same DFS approach. The only difference will be to ignore the paths with negative sums. Since we need to find the overall maximum sum, we should ignore any path which has an overall negative sum.
