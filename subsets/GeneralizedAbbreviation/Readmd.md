Given a word, write a function to generate all of its unique generalized abbreviations.

Generalized abbreviation of a word can be generated by replacing each substring of the word by the count of characters in the substring. Take the example of “ab” which has four substrings: “”, “a”, “b”, and “ab”. After replacing these substrings in the actual word by the count of characters we get all the generalized abbreviations: “ab”, “1b”, “a1”, and “2”.
