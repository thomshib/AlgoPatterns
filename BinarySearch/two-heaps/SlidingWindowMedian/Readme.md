Given an array of numbers and a number ‘k’, find the median of all the ‘k’ sized sub-arrays (or windows) of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums=[1, 2, -1, 3, 5], k = 2
Output: [1.5, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0]
Explanation: Lets consider all windows of size ‘2’:

    [1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 1.5
    [1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 0.5
    [1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 1.0
    [1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 4.0
