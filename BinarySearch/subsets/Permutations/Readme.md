Given a set of distinct numbers, find all of its permutations.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the elements of the set. For example, {1, 2, 3} has the following six permutations:

    {1, 2, 3}
    {1, 3, 2}
    {2, 1, 3}
    {2, 3, 1}
    {3, 1, 2}
    {3, 2, 1}

Given a string, find all of its permutations preserving the character sequence but changing case.

Example 1:

Input: "ad52"
Output: "ad52", "Ad52", "aD52", "AD52"
