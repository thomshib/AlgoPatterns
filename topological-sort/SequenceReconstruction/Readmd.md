    We need to build the graph of the numbers by comparing each pair of numbers in the given array of sequences.
    We must perform the topological sort for the graph to determine two things:
        Can the topological ordering construct the originalSeq?
        That there is only one topological ordering of the numbers possible. This can be confirmed if we do not have more than one source at any time while finding the topological ordering of numbers.
