We are given an undirected graph that has characteristics of a k-ary tree. In such a graph, we can choose any node as the root to make a k-ary tree. The root (or the tree) with the minimum height will be called Minimum Height Tree (MHT). There can be multiple MHTs for a graph. In this problem, we need to find all those roots which give us MHTs. Write a method to find all MHTs of the given graph and return a list of their roots.


Solution

This gives us a strategy to find MHTs. Since leaves can’t give us MHT, we can remove them from the graph and remove their edges too. Once we remove the leaves, we will have new leaves. Since these new leaves can’t give us MHT, we will repeat the process and remove them from the graph too. We will prune the leaves until we are left with one or two nodes which will be our answer and the roots for MHTs.

We can implement the above process using the topological sort. Any node with only one edge (i.e., a leaf) can be our source and, in a stepwise fashion, we can remove all sources from the graph to find new sources. We will repeat this process until we are left with one or two nodes in the graph, which will be our answer.
